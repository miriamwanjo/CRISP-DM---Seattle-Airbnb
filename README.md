# CRISP-DM---Seattle-Airbnb
## Project Motivation

> This project is part of the Udacity coursework utilizing the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process to analyze data. The CRISP-DM process includes 6 steps;

1. Developing business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Preparing data to be analyzed
4. Data modelling
5. Evaluating results to answer questions
6. Deploying changes based on the results

> I utilized the Seattle Airbnb data from kaggle.com. Using this data, I was interested in answering these 3 questions:

1. What combination of variables are good predictors of rental prices?
2. What time of the year are average prices high and when are they low?
3. What is the variability among property types in relation to prices?

## Summary of Results
